= Disclaimer =

First of all, a warning: if you’ve never used gst-launch before (or gstreamer
for that matter), you probably won’t find this tool very easy to use.
On the other hand, if you want to reconfigure and play with your gstreamer
pipelines via the command line while they’re running, this is the tool for you.

= Installation =

== Debian ==

{{{
#!sh
$ sudo aptitude install python-gi gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
# (gstreamer-0.10 will probably work as well)

$ virtualenv --system-site-packages .

$ . bin/activate
$ pip install -e hg+http://hg.flowblok.id.au/gst-launch-dynamic
}}}
